UVA-Solutions
=============

My solutions to the UVA problems that I have solved successfully. I have created all of the code myself.

I'm currently in Computing Science at the University of Alberta.

These are usually not the most optimal solutions, but they all are accepted within the given time limit.

My UVA account is Diusrex.

Feel free to look at these solutions for assistance on a problem, but please don't just copy my solutions, because there is no point in doing so.
